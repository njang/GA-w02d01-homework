const rainbow = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];
// 2. Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
console.log(rainbow[4]);
// 3. Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.
const neoJang = {
	favoriteFood: "seafood",
	hobby: "auto mechanic",
	residence: "Austin",
	dataType: "boolean"
}
// 4. Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.
console.log(neoJang.hobby);

// Crazy Object!
const crazyObject = {
  taco: [{meat: 'steak',
         cheese: ['panela', 'queso', 'chihuahua']},
         {meat: 'chicken',
          salsa: ["pico", "hot", "hotter", "really hot", "really really hot", "omg my mouth is burning"]},
        ],
  larry: {
    nicknames: ["LD", "Chicken Teriyaki Boyyyyyy"],
    quotes: ["Pretty pretty prettayyyyy good", "Is that a parkinson's thing?", "women love a self confident bald man", "I'm a walking talking enigma"],
    characters: [{
      name: "Jeff",
      occupation: "manager"
    },
    {
      name: "funkhauser",
      occupation: "tv dude"
    },
    {
      name: "susie",
      occupation: "jeffs wife",
      favourtieHobby: "Swearing at Larry and Jeff"
    },
    ]
  }
}

// Use crazy Object to log the following.
// 1. "omg my mouth is burning"
console.log(crazyObject.taco[1].salsa[5]);
// 2. "Pretty pretty prettayyyyy good"
console.log(crazyObject.larry.quotes[0]);
// 3. "Swearing at Larry and Jeff"
console.log(crazyObject.larry.characters[2].favourtieHobby);
// 4. "Chicken Teriyaki Boyyyyyy"
console.log(crazyObject.larry.nicknames[1]);
// 5. The object the contains the name `funkhauser`
console.log(crazyObject.larry.characters[1].name);
